## Migration Guides

### Upgrading to v1.0.0 from Beta

**Database Migrations:**
```bash
# Run database migration scripts
npm run migrate:up

# Update indexes for performance
npm run db:reindex

# Verify data integrity
npm run db:verify
```

**Configuration Updates:**
```bash
# Update environment variables
cp .env.example .env.v1
# Edit .env.v1 with new configuration options

# Update Docker configurations
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d
```

**API Changes:**
- Authentication endpoints moved from `/auth/*` to `/api/auth/*`
- Workflow execution endpoint changed from `/workflows/run` to `/workflows/{id}/execute`
- User management endpoints now require admin role
- New pagination format for list endpoints

**Breaking Changes:**
- Workflow step configuration format updated (migration tool available)
- User role permissions restructured (automatic migration)
- API response format standardized (update client applications)
- Database schema changes (automatic migration with downtime)

### New Feature Adoption

**AI Services Integration:**
```javascript
// New AI classification endpoint
const response = await fetch('/api/ai/classify-text', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` },
  body: JSON.stringify({ text: 'Email content', model: 'email-classifier' })
});
```

**Enhanced Workflow Features:**
```javascript
// New conditional branching syntax
{
  "type": "conditional",
  "config": {
    "condition": "data.priority === 'high'",
    "trueBranch": [/* steps */],
    "falseBranch": [/* steps */]
  }
}
```
