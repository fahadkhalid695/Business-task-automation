# Workflow Automation Specification

## Overview
This specification defines the requirements and implementation details for the comprehensive workflow automation system within the Business Task Automation Platform.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### FR-1: Workflow Creation and Management
- **FR-1.1**: Users must be able to create workflows using a visual designer
- **FR-1.2**: Workflows must support conditional branching and parallel execution
- **FR-1.3**: Users must be able to save workflows as reusable templates
- **FR-1.4**: System must validate workflow configurations before execution

#### FR-2: Task Orchestration
- **FR-2.1**: System must execute workflow steps in the correct order
- **FR-2.2**: Failed steps must trigger appropriate error handling and retry logic
- **FR-2.3**: System must support pause/resume functionality for long-running workflows
- **FR-2.4**: Task scheduling must support priority-based execution

#### FR-3: AI Integration
- **FR-3.1**: Workflows must integrate with AI services for text classification
- **FR-3.2**: System must support sentiment analysis within workflow steps
- **FR-3.3**: Translation services must be available as workflow components
- **FR-3.4**: AI model performance must be monitored and reported

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### NFR-1: Performance
- **NFR-1.1**: Workflow execution must complete within 30 seconds for standard workflows
- **NFR-1.2**: System must support 1000+ concurrent workflow executions
- **NFR-1.3**: API response times must be under 2 seconds for 95% of requests

#### NFR-2: Reliability
- **NFR-2.1**: System uptime must be 99.9% or higher
- **NFR-2.2**: Data consistency must be maintained across all services
- **NFR-2.3**: Failed workflows must be recoverable and resumable

#### NFR-3: Security
- **NFR-3.1**: All workflow data must be encrypted at rest and in transit
- **NFR-3.2**: Role-based access control must restrict workflow access
- **NFR-3.3**: Audit logging must track all workflow operations

## Design

### Architecture Components

#### Workflow Engine
- **Purpose**: Core orchestration of workflow execution
- **Location**: `services/src/task-orchestrator/workflow-engine.ts`
- **Key Classes**: `WorkflowEngine`, `StepProcessor`, `ExecutionContext`

#### Task Scheduler
- **Purpose**: Queue management and task distribution
- **Location**: `services/src/task-orchestrator/task-scheduler.ts`
- **Key Classes**: `TaskScheduler`, `PriorityQueue`, `TaskExecutor`

#### AI Service Integration
- **Purpose**: Integration with machine learning models
- **Location**: `services/src/ai-ml-engine/`
- **Key Classes**: `ModelManager`, `InferenceEngine`, `ClassificationService`

### Data Models

#### Workflow Schema
```typescript
interface Workflow {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description?: string;
  steps: WorkflowStep[];
  triggers: WorkflowTrigger[];
  status: WorkflowStatus;
  createdBy: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

interface WorkflowStep {
  id: string;
  type: StepType;
  name: string;
  config: StepConfig;
  dependencies: string[];
  retryPolicy: RetryPolicy;
  timeout: number;
}
```

#### Execution Schema
```typescript
interface WorkflowExecution {
  id: string;
  workflowId: string;
  status: ExecutionStatus;
  startTime: Date;
  endTime?: Date;
  steps: StepExecution[];
  context: ExecutionContext;
  error?: ExecutionError;
}
```

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 5: Testing and Deployment
- [x] Comprehensive test suite (unit, integration, E2E)
- [x] Performance and security testing
- [x] Docker containerization
- [x] Kubernetes deployment configurations

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- All workflow engine components must have 90%+ test coverage
- Mock external dependencies for isolated testing
- Test error conditions and edge cases

### Integration Testing
- Test workflow execution end-to-end
- Verify AI service integration
- Test database operations and data consistency

### Performance Testing
- Load test with 1000+ concurrent workflows
- Stress test individual components
- Monitor resource usage and optimization opportunities

## Acceptance Criteria

### Workflow Creation
- [ ] User can create a workflow with multiple steps
- [ ] Workflow validation prevents invalid configurations
- [ ] Templates can be saved and reused
- [ ] Workflows can be shared between users

### Workflow Execution

- [ ] Conditional branching works as expected
- [ ] Error handling and retries function properly
- [ ] Real-time monitoring shows accurate status

### AI Integration
- [ ] Text classification achieves 85%+ accuracy
- [ ] Sentiment analysis provides meaningful results
- [ ] Translation services support required languages
- [ ] Model performance is monitored and reported
